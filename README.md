The microCLUSTER project

"Nowadays, High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are used in a wide variety of domains to increase application performance. Unfortunatly, the systems are usually hidden in a server room and not open to the public. For most people, this makes  the concepts of parallelism and distribution at the heart of the HPC systems quite hard to imagine and to grasp. Still, there are projects which make HPC clusters more accessible to the broader audience. "WeeArchie" (a portable cluster) from the University of Edinburgh is such an example which inspired us when elaborating the goal for this thesis. We expand on their ideas to make parallelism in computing more visible. For this purpose, we present "microCLUSTER": A cluster consisting of 64 Odroid C2 single board computers. They are placed in a cube arrangement, custom designed as a part of this thesis work to offer an easy accessible hands-on experience. With microCLUSTER, many aspects of a larger HPC system like operating system, storage and communication can be more easily grasped via visual interaction. We also analyse the performance-to-price-ratio of the microCLUSTER by CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and network-intensive benchmarks. These experimental results help us to better understand the possible performance advantages and/or limitations of such a system."
